## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Anna Bison, a MSc student in Computer Science at the [DM](https://www.math.unipd.it). Previously, I obtained my BSc in Physics at the [DFA](https://www.dfa.unipd.it).
I enjoy using mathematics to analyze anything.

Non-scientific interests include (currently) gym and running.
During high school, I dedicated three intense years to (obsessively) [playing piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzEqQUG-qkw).

This is my personal webpage, a work in progress that Iâ€™ll eventually complete with more advanced features (ðŸ¤Œ).
