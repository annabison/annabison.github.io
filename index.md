### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Anna Bison, a PhD student in Computer Science at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.unipd.it, University of Padova, working on Graph Neural Networks under the supervision of Prof. Alessandro Sperduti.

I hold a MSc in Computer Science and a BSc in Physics, both from the University of Padua. I enjoy using mathematics to analyze anything.

My non-scientific interests include gym and running. During high school, I also dedicated three intense years to [playing piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzEqQUG-qkw).
